# NomadDesignLabs
Building a website for my new Design Lab. Our focus will be on Web Design and Development, and Graphic Design.

I have been taking a Web Design course this semester at school, and have found it to be a lot of fun, and am looking to pursue it more seriously.
The Website will be a place where potential clients can access my portfolio, contact me, and even find some merch at some point.
